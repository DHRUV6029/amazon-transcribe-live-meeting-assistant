TO BE COMPLETED

## Clean Up

Congratulations! :tada: You have completed all the steps for setting up your live call analytics sample solution using AWS services.

**To make sure you are not charged for any unwanted services, you can clean up by deleting the stack created in the _Deploy_ section and its resources.**

When youâ€™re finished experimenting with this sample solution, clean up your resources by using the AWS CloudFormation console to delete the LiveCallAnalytics stacks that you deployed. This deletes resources that were created by deploying the solution. The recording S3 buckets, the DynamoDB table and CloudWatch Log groups are retained after the stack is deleted to avoid deleting your data.
